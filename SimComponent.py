Step #	TASK / WHAT YOU MUST DO	KEY POINTS & COUNTRY-SPECIFIC CALL-OUTS
1	Classify the data	Determine whether the info is ITAR technical data, EAR technology, DSGL-listed, CCL-listed, etc. AU: verify it’s not on the Excluded Technologies List. US: cost/schedule info alone is not controlled.
2	Identify an authorization (or exemption)	Find the export authorization(s) that cover the data (TAA, MLA, AUKUS exemption, DEC permit, MA 0793-11, etc.). AU: file a DEC notification via MADE if using an AUKUS exemption. CA: 0E606/3E606/7E606 tech may move within Canada; ITAR VII(i)/XI(d)/XII(f) still need a TAA. UK: need a completed Document Transmittal List (DTL) before upload.
3	Confirm you are a delegate	Ensure you and every recipient are listed as delegates/sub-licensees on the authorization(s). AU: AUKUS carve-outs don’t apply to GDLS-C; delegation still required.
4	Validate recipient location & NDA	Verify each user’s physical location is approved and that required NDAs are in place.
5	Mark the document or data set	Label the upload with authorization number(s), export-control category (USML/ECCN/DSGL, etc.), and any re-transfer/end-use notes.
6	Transfer via the approved channel	US / CA / AU: upload directly once Steps 1-5 are done. UK: send to Data Management with the DTL; they will upload and record it.
7	Log the transfer	Record the transaction under the same authorization in the export-control database. Daily transfers → weekly summary OK; sporadic transfers → log each one.
8	Monitor re-transfer rules	Before sharing with any new party/country, repeat Steps 2-7 (may need a new TAA or amendment). Example: U.S. design help re-exported from Canada.
9	When in doubt → Trade Compliance	If anything is unclear, pause the upload and consult Trade Compliance.
