This notebook quickly groups similar terms in your report text so you can find synonym-like patterns.
It uses TF-IDF and fast clustering methods (MiniBatchKMeans, Birch, and NMF) to create clusters of related words or short phrases.
The silhouette score shows how well terms fit within their cluster (higher is better), while the mean/median cluster size and percent in tiny clusters show how evenly terms are grouped—smaller “tiny cluster” percentages mean better overall clustering.
