Unified Guidance for Working in Export-Controlled Shared Spaces
(US — ITAR/EAR, Canada — ECL/ITAR, Australia — DSGL/USML)

Purpose
Provide a single, harmonized procedure for uploading, storing, and transferring technical data in any GDLS-managed shared space that is accessible to personnel in the United States, Canada, and Australia. This guidance ensures compliance with all relevant control regimes (ITAR, EAR, Canadian ECL/ITAR, and Australia’s DSGL/USML) while streamlining day-to-day practice for users who collaborate across these jurisdictions.

⸻

1. Determine If the Data Are Controlled

1.1 Identify the content.
• Any information required for the design, development, manufacture, production, operation, testing, or repair of a controlled article (e.g., drawings, CAD models, source code, test reports, manufacturing plans) is presumed controlled.
• Purely commercial or administrative data (costs, schedules, generic part lists) are normally not controlled.

1.2 Classify the item.
• US: Check ITAR (USML) and EAR (CCL).
• Canada: Check Export Control List (ECL) and ITAR if US-origin.
• Australia: Check Defence & Strategic Goods List (DSGL) and USML if US-origin.
If uncertain, seek Trade Compliance support before proceeding.

2. Confirm Authorization Before Sharing

2.1 Verify an active export authorization or exemption that covers the data, the destination users, and each destination country (e.g., TAA, MLA, GCL, export permit, AUKUS exemption).

2.2 Delegate approval.
Ensure every person who will upload, download, or modify the data is listed as an authorized user or delegate under the applicable license/exemption.

⸻

3. Prepare the Data Package

3.1 Mark each file with its governing authorization number(s) and the relevant control category (e.g., ITAR § 121.1 Cat VIII (f), DSGL Schedule 3 Part 2).

3.2 Redact or segregate any information that is outside the approved scope. When in doubt, split files so only the approved content is uploaded.

⸻

4. Upload & Release Only to Approved Recipients

4.1 Confirm user location & nationality.
Users must reside in, and access the system from, territories permitted by the authorization.

4.2 Verify NDA coverage.
A current, compliant NDA (ITAR or local equivalent) must be in place with every external entity receiving access.

⸻

5. Log Every Transfer

5.1 Create a transfer log entry in the Export Control Database each time controlled data are:
• Added to the shared space,
• Downloaded, or
• Modified in a way that changes the technical content.

5.2 Frequency.
• Continuous or high-volume projects → aggregate weekly log is acceptable.
• Sporadic transfers → log each action individually.

⸻

6. Maintain Ongoing Compliance

6.1 Keep delegations current. Remove users who leave a program; add new ones promptly.

6.2 Review authorizations quarterly (or sooner if scope changes) to confirm coverage remains valid.

6.3 Audit readiness. Shared-space records and logs are subject to routine internal and regulatory audits in all three countries.

7. When in Doubt, Ask

Immediately contact Trade Compliance if you are unsure about classification, authorization scope, user eligibility, or any other aspect of this procedure.

Notes
	•	Any US-origin technical contribution embedded in Canadian or Australian work products may change the country-of-origin status and trigger new US authorization requirements for future sharing.
	•	Placing any controlled document in a GDLS Knowledge Management or collaboration system automatically constitutes an export to every country where authorized users reside; ensure your authorization covers each destination before uploading.
