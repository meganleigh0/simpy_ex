This notebook takes your reliability report text data and automatically finds groups of words that mean similar things.
It uses spaCy and Sentence Transformers to turn words into numeric vectors that capture their meanings, then applies clustering methods (Agglomerative and HDBSCAN) to group synonyms together.
It measures how cohesive and distinct the clusters are, compares three baseline methods, and prints a summary table with metrics so you can see which performs best.
In short, it helps you identify and evaluate synonym clusters in your datasetâ€”so you can standardize or simplify language across reports.
