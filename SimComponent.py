Shared-Spaces Export-Control Checklist
(Applies to GDLS operations in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia)

⸻

	1.	Classify the data
	•	Assume control if the material is used in design, manufacture, test, or repair (drawings, CAD, models, software, test results, etc.).
	•	Check the relevant lists: ITAR/EAR (US), EIPA & Canadian ITAR, UK Strategic Export Controls, DSGL / USML / CCL (AU).
	•	Cost, schedule, and generic parts lists are typically not controlled.
	•	Unsure? Stop and call Trade Compliance.
	2.	Confirm you hold a valid authorisation
	•	Licence, permit, exemption, or agreement must cover every intended recipient and every country of access (e.g., TAA, MLA, DSP-5, EAR licence, OGEL, MA, AUKUS/DEC exemption).
	•	For AUKUS exemptions, submit notification to Defence Export Controls (DEC) via the MADE portal before release.
	3.	Verify delegation and NDAs
	•	You—and anyone you will grant access—must be a named delegate on the authorisation.
	•	Ensure each user has an NDA that satisfies ITAR or local rules.
	•	UK uploads: complete a Document Transmittal Form (DTL); the Data Management team performs the actual upload.
	4.	Prepare and mark the file
	•	Add to the header or metadata:
• Authorisation / permit number(s)
• Control category (e.g., ITAR XI(d), 0E606.a, DSGL Sch 3)
• Country of origin
• The banner “EXPORT CONTROLLED”
	•	Remove or redact any content outside the licence scope.
	5.	Release only to approved users in approved territories
	•	Grant KBS access solely to individuals verified in Step 3.
	•	ITAR data: any re-transfer outside the original licence (e.g., CA→UK, UK→AU) requires a new TAA/MLA.
	•	Canada: most EAR items may be shared internally; ITAR items may not.
	6.	Log the transfer
	•	Record every upload, download, or technical change in the Export-Control database.
	•	High-volume projects: a weekly summary log is acceptable; sporadic actions require individual entries.
	7.	Maintain ongoing compliance
	•	Review licences, delegate lists, and NDAs quarterly; remove departed users immediately.
	•	Embedding US- or AU-origin technology in another country’s work product can trigger new licensing—validate before further export.
