GDLS – Unified Export-Control Guidance for Shared Collaboration Spaces

(Applicable to all U.S., Canadian, and Australian personnel and partners)

1  Determine Whether the Data Are Export-Controlled
	•	Presume technical control for anything used in design, manufacture, test, or repair (e.g., drawings, models, software, test results).
	•	Classify against the ITAR/EAR (U.S.), ECL / ITAR (Canada), and DSGL / USML (Australia). Confirm items are not on Australia’s Excluded Technologies List (ETL).
	•	Remember: uploading to a GDLS shared space is an export to every user location represented in that space.

2  Confirm the Correct Authorisation
	•	Hold an active TAA, MLA, export permit, General Export Licence, AUKUS/DEC exemption, or equivalent that covers:
	1.	the specific data,
	2.	every intended recipient, and
	3.	every country from which access will occur.
	•	For AUKUS exemptions, submit notification to Defence Export Controls (DEC) via the MADE portal before release.

3  Verify Delegations and NDAs
	•	You —and all collaborators—must be named delegates on the governing authorisation.
	•	Ensure a current NDA that satisfies ITAR (or local) requirements is in place for every external entity.

4  Prepare and Mark the Files
	•	Apply, on every file:
	•	Authorisation or permit number(s),
	•	Control-list reference (e.g., ITAR Cat VIII (f); ECCN 3E001; DSGL Sch 3), and
	•	Country of origin.
	•	Redact or separate any content outside the licence scope.

5  Release Only to Approved Users in Approved Territories
	•	Confirm each user’s citizenship, location, and licence status before granting access.
	•	Canadian re-transfers and any intra-company sharing must undergo a fresh control review unless specifically exempted (e.g., EAR 0E66/3E606/7E606 items within Canada).

6  Log Every Transfer
	•	Record each upload, download, or technical modification in the Export-Control database.
	•	High-volume projects: a weekly summary log is acceptable.
	•	Sporadic actions: log each event individually.

7  Maintain Ongoing Compliance
	•	Review licences and delegate lists quarterly; remove departing users immediately.
	•	US-origin inputs embedded in Canadian or Australian work products may trigger new U.S. licensing before further export—validate before release.
